## Run Scraper Demo

Run Scraper scrapes the webmaster "picks" from the home page of www.runningintheusa.com and displays those races on the app's home page. Users have the ability to remove races if they would like and run the scrape again. Users may also save races, after which they'll be displayed in the saved races page. User may also leave "notes" on a race with their saved races and have the ability to delete those notes as well.
